# Ray Tracing in One Weekend

This is my .NET Core 3.1 port of Peter Shirley's [Ray Tracing in One Weekend](https://raytracing.github.io/) which is now available for free. I bought his books when they came out and never got around to implementing them. It'll make for a fun holiday project.

_.This is my port. There are many like it, but this one is mine._
