# Ray Tracing in One Weekend

---

This is my .NET Core port of Peter Shirley's [Ray Tracing in One Weekend](https://raytracing.github.io/) which is now available for free. I bought his books when they came out and never got around to implementing them. It'll make for a fun holiday project.

_There are many ports, but this one is mine._
